# Recipe Buddy

Recipe Buddy is a platform that makes use of Edamam's Recipe Search API ([edamam.com](https://developer.edamam.com/)) which allows users to look up recipes based on an ingredient of their choosing.

Users are only able to pull a limited number of recipes in a limted number of time; 10 recipes per search/ 10 searches per minute- due to the limitations of using the free API package. This can be achieved by typing any ingredient of their choosing into the input field, which, in turn, retrieves recipes that include said ingredient in its list of ingredients. 

## Deployment

The site has been hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://gerakas.github.io/React-Recipe-App/).

## UI
